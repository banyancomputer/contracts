[![Escrow Contract CI](https://github.com/banyancomputer/contracts/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/banyancomputer/contracts/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)


## ðŸ”§ Setting up local development

### Requirements

- [Node v16](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v16.x/)  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Local Setup Steps

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/banyancomputer/contracts.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables (keys) and add your private keys
cp .env.example .env # (linux)
copy .env.example .env # (windows)

#To Deploy Contracts:
source .env
forge script script/Banyan.s.sol:BanyanDeployScript --rpc-url $GOERLI_RPC_ENDPOINT --private-key $DEPLOYER_PK --broadcast

# Let's fork mainnet
anvil --fork-url https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/$INFURA_KEY
```

### Notes for `localhost`
-   The `deployments/localhost` directory is included in the git repository,
    so that the contract addresses remain constant. Otherwise, the frontend's
    `constants.ts` file would need to be updated.
-   Avoid committing changes to the `deployments/localhost` files (unless you
    are sure), as this will alter the state of the hardhat node when deployed
    in tests.

## ðŸ“– Guides
- Check out `./test/test.ts` for a full example of how to interact with the contract.
